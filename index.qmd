title: "Dependency ratios in Washington State 2011-2021"
---

## Overview
Dependency ratios are important quantities that facilitate policy planning. They provide interested governmental and non-governmental entities insight into population dynamics for regions of interest. The insights gain can help planners to anticipate changing needs as age demographics within the population change. Given scarcity of resources, dependency ratios can inform where limited funds can best be applied to ensure that they are used effectively, efficiently, and equitably.  

## Dependency ratio definitions
3 different dependency ratios will be considered in this analysis: total dependency, child dependency, and elderly dependency. These ratios, as defined by *File & Kominski (2009)* are:

**Total dependency ratio** - the ratio of all dependents to non-dependents.
$$
\frac{\text{child dependents} + \text{elderly dependents}}{\text{non-dependents}}\times 100
$$
**Child dependency ratio** - The ratio of children, aged 0 to 18, in the population to the total number of non-dependents or producers in the population.
$$
\frac{\text{child dependents}}{\text{non-dependents}}\times 100
$$
**elderly dependency ratio** - The ratio of adults, aged 65 and up, in the population to the total number of non-dependents or producers in the population.
$$
\frac{\text{elderly dependents}}{\text{non-dependents}}\times 100
$$
Non-dependents are defined as those individuals in the population, aged 18 to 64, who are available to contribute to the economy, producing good and services and paying taxes.

Dependency ratios approaching 100 are considered problematic as this implies a 1:1 ratio of dependents to those providing the revenue to fund services. There are a number of short comings with this system, as detailed by File & Kominski, but it is still a useful way of analysing population dynamics.
